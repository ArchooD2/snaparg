# snaparg
snaparg is a lightweight wrapper around Python's built-in argparse library that adds automatic typo detection and helpful suggestions for command-line arguments. Instead of failing silently or throwing obscure errors, snaparg analyzes incorrect flags and proposes the closest valid alternatives.
